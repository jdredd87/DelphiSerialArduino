# DelphiSerialArduino

Delphi Serial Com to Arduino for a stepper motor

Ugly little program to show how to serial communicate from Delphi to an Arduino 
via the USB Serial interface.

Using AsnycPro ( free serial package for Delphi )

Program has very little if any error checking and such.

Some of the serial grabbing isn't perfect. Really should use events in AsnycPro to grab data packets.

But it is good enough to get the point across.
